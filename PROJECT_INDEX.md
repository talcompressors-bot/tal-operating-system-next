# PROJECT INDEX

## Repository

Name:
TalCompressors-ServiceReports-AI

Purpose:
Master source for ServiceApp_FIX project.

---

## Mandatory Startup Entry

Every Codex or ChatGPT project session must start with this file.

Official startup command:

- `hey codex`

Official shutdown command:

- `by codex`

Required startup order:

1. PROJECT_INDEX.md
2. PROJECT_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md
3. project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md
4. project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md
5. Relevant task-specific docs

No implementation task may start until a short Project Reality Check is shown from the canonical files.

If the Project Reality Check cannot be produced, STOP and report the missing canonical source.

Project Reality Check must include:

- current phase
- last known commit
- current task
- next approved task
- blocked or forbidden actions
- files relevant to the requested work

If ChatGPT or Codex memory conflicts with Project Brain files, Project Brain wins.

When the user says `hey codex`:

1. Read `PROJECT_INDEX.md` first.
2. Produce Project Reality Check.
3. Continue from next approved task only.
4. Do not invent new tasks.

When the user says `by codex`:

1. Run Project Reality Check.
2. Run `git status --short --branch`.
3. Identify changed files.
4. Summarize completed work.
5. Summarize uncommitted changes.
6. Update canonical state files when needed and approved:
   - `PROJECT_INDEX.md`
   - `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md`
   - `project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md`
   - `project-brain/DECISION_LOG.md` if decisions changed
7. Verify no forbidden systems were touched.
8. Verify next approved task is clear.
9. Commit only approved files.
10. Push to `origin/main`.
11. Confirm clean `git status --short --branch`.
12. Print next `hey codex` startup point.

Before creating any new planning file, map, dashboard, control center, protocol, agent, or roadmap, Codex must search existing files and prove no existing file already serves that purpose.

## Project Reality Check

This section is the living navigation screen. It summarizes current reality only by pointing to canonical owner files; do not duplicate full source content here.

| Field | Current Reality | Canonical Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Current phase | Project Brain Consolidation Phase 1-3 completed; PostgreSQL Environment planning is next | `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| Current milestone | Startup and shutdown paths enforced; retired current task references cleaned | `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md` |
| Current task | Prepare PostgreSQL/Supabase shadow environment planning after consolidation | `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| Next approved task | PostgreSQL/Supabase shadow environment planning, not implementation | `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md` |
| Last verified commit | `e36c35e Implement hey codex and by codex workflow` | Git history; `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| Completed phases | Governance foundation; Next.js shadow app; PostgreSQL V1 scope/schema; Prisma validation tooling; Project Brain Consolidation Phase 1-3; startup/shutdown workflow enforcement | `project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md`, `project-brain/PROJECT_BRAIN_MASTER.md` |
| Blocked/forbidden actions | No production writes, Prisma migration, DB creation, Sheets/AppSheet/Maven actions, new planning/control files, new agents, or implementation before Reality Check | `PROJECT_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md`, `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| Evidence links | Current task, task board, decisions, system map, migration scope, Prisma schema, protocol | Canonical file links below |

Canonical file links:

- Current state: `project-brain/CURRENT_TASK.md`
- Task board: `project-brain/TASK_BOARD.md`
- Decisions: `project-brain/DECISION_LOG.md`
- System map: `project-brain/maps/SYSTEM_MAP.md`
- Migration scope: `project-brain/migration/POSTGRESQL_V1_SCOPE.md`
- Prisma schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Protocol: `PROJECT_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md`

## Supporting Read Order

After the mandatory startup files, read only the supporting files relevant to the task:

- START_CODEX.md, if using the Codex startup wrapper
- PROJECT_COMMANDS.md, if interpreting project commands
- agents/AGENT_REGISTRY.md, if routing agent work
- agents/INFRASTRUCTURE_MANAGER_AGENT.md, for architecture, schema, migration, source-of-truth, or future-platform work
- project-brain/PROJECT_BRAIN_MASTER.md, for durable memory
- project-brain/DECISION_LOG.md, for approved decisions
- project-brain/maps/SYSTEM_MAP.md, for the canonical system map
- project-brain/migration/POSTGRESQL_V1_SCOPE.md, for PostgreSQL migration scope
- prisma/schema.prisma, for the current Prisma schema
- data-sources/tools/SHEETS_REGISTRY.md, for sheet/schema evidence
- Latest relevant historical checkpoint under project-brain/checkpoints/, for historical context only
